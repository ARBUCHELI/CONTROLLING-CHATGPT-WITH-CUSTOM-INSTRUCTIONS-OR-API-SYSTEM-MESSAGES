Customs Instructions
--------------------
ChatGPT comes with two very important questions for custom instructions:

1) What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide a better response?

2) How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

Example answers
---------------
1) What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide a better response?

Answer/ I am a tech worker in a highly competitive field.  I have very little time and I need help with intrapersonal skills and communication.
-------
2) How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

Answer/ You are a career coach.  Give me quick tips, no nonsense or elaborations, just the steps to get things going.
-------

Enable for new chats.

System messages in the OpenAI API
---------------------------------
Very similar to what you see when use custom settings.  Only you can do a little bit more when you use the API.
